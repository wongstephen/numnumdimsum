Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a little Corgi named Num Num. Num Num was a happy and playful pup, but there was one thing that he loved more than anything else in the world â€“ dim sum!

Num Num would spend his days dreaming about the delicious dumplings, buns, and other treats that he loved so much. He would run through the fields, imagining that he was chasing after a plate of steaming hot dim sum.

One day, Num Num's owner took him to the local dim sum restaurant. Num Num was so excited that he could hardly contain himself. He wagged his tail so hard that it nearly wagged right off!

When they got to the restaurant, Num Num's owner ordered a plate of dim sum for him. Num Num couldn't believe his eyes when the plate arrived. There were steamed buns, dumplings, and even a little dish of sweet sticky rice. Num Num was in heaven!

He ate and ate until he couldn't eat anymore. He was so full that he could hardly wag his tail. But Num Num was not satisfied. He wanted more and more dim sum!

From that day on, every time Num Num's owner took him to the dim sum restaurant, Num Num would eat and eat until he couldn't eat anymore. He loved dim sum so much that he even started to dream about it at night.

Years went by, and Num Num grew up to be a big and strong Corgi. But he never lost his love for dim sum. And every time he went to the dim sum restaurant, he would wag his tail so hard that it nearly wagged right off, just like the very first time.

The end.

Moral of the story: Never lose your passion for something you love, and always be grateful for the things that bring you happiness.
